## What is Chicane?

Chicane is a SwiftUI app for simple, weekend podium-pick betting between family and friends.

For each race event, each player picks:
- P1
- P2
- P3

When actual results are entered, scoring is position-exact:
- +1 for correct P1
- +1 for correct P2
- +1 for correct P3
- Total: 0 to 3 points per event

Chicane tracks standings across:
- Formula 1 season totals
- MotoGP season totals
- Combined totals

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Podium Picks | Create/edit picks per series, round, and player. Supports multiple concurrent players with independent drafts. |
| Results Update + Locking | Tap `Update Results` to fetch official top-3 podium, then lock to prevent accidental edits. |
| Exact Scoring | Position-only scoring (no points for correct driver/rider in wrong position). |
| Scoreboard | Series and combined standings, plus per-event score history. |
| In-App News Reader | Motorsport.com RSS news feed with Safari Reader mode — loads clean, ad-free articles in-app. |
| Spoiler Safety | No race spoilers by default; the News tab is blurred on entry until the user explicitly continues. |
| Offline Fallback | Works with bundled seed data if network sources are unavailable. |
| Accessibility | Large tap targets, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, high-contrast friendly UI. |
| Premium UI | Apple-material based "Liquid Glass" visual design with themed motorsport color accents. |

## Main Screens

- **Home** — Next race countdown, season standings snapshot, quick stats
- **Picks** — Enter and edit each player's P1/P2/P3 predictions per event
- **Results** — Enter official results and lock events
- **Scoreboard** — Season standings and per-event history (F1, MotoGP, Combined)
- **News** — Latest F1 and MotoGP news via RSS, read in-app with Reader mode after an entry confirmation
- **Settings** — Manage players, season bet text, and season reset

---

## How it works

1. App launches and loads local season state.
2. Driver/rider lists and calendars refresh from online sources when available.
3. If network fetch fails, bundled seed JSON is used automatically.
4. Users enter picks for each event per player.
5. Users tap `Update Results` to pull official podium results and lock the event.
6. Standings are computed deterministically from stored picks and results.

## Architecture Overview

Chicane follows SwiftUI + MVVM with focused repositories and services.

### App Layer
- `ChicaneApp` — entry point; injects all repositories into `AppViewModel`.
- `RootTabView` — tab navigation with banner and loading overlays.

### View Model
- `AppViewModel` — single source of truth; orchestrates UI state, load/save operations, scoring, and screen-level interactions.

### Repositories
- `OnlineDriverRepository` — fetches current F1 drivers and MotoGP riders from official sources
- `OnlineCalendarRepository` — fetches F1 and MotoGP event calendars
- `OnlineResultRepository` — fetches official top-3 podium results
- `RSSNewsRepository` — fetches and parses Motorsport.com RSS news feeds
- `FallbackDriverRepository` / `FallbackCalendarRepository` — online-first with bundled seed fallback
- `LocalSeasonRepository` — actor-isolated persistence for picks, results, players, and settings

### Services
- `ScoringService` — per-event points calculation
- `ScoreboardCalculator` — season standings and event history aggregation
- `FileStateStore` — actor-based atomic JSON file I/O
- `F1OfficialHTMLParser` — parses formula1.com for drivers, calendar, and results
- `RSSParser` — parses Motorsport.com RSS feeds into `NewsArticle` models
- `RemoteDataClient` — shared URLSession HTTP client with encoding fallback
- `BundleJSONLoader` — loads bundled seed JSON resources

---

## Data Sources

Online-first with offline fallback:

- **Formula 1** — `formula1.com` for drivers, calendar, and official podium results
- **MotoGP** — `motogp.com` / Pulse Live API for riders and calendar events
- **News** — Motorsport.com public RSS feeds (`motorsport.com/rss/f1/news/` and `/rss/motogp/news/`)
- **Bundled seed data** (fallback):
  - `Chicane/Resources/Seed/drivers.json`
  - `Chicane/Resources/Seed/calendar.json`

## Build and Run

### Requirements
- macOS with Xcode 16+
- iOS Simulator runtime (26.2 used in CI/local commands below)

### Xcode
1. Open `Chicane.xcodeproj`
2. Select scheme `Chicane`
3. Run on iPhone or iPad simulator

### CLI
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme Chicane -project Chicane.xcodeproj -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
xcodebuild -scheme Chicane -project Chicane.xcodeproj -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17,OS=26.2' -only-testing:ChicaneTests test
```

---

## Persistence and Privacy

- No account required.
- All picks, results, players, and settings are stored on-device.
  - Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Chicane/season_state_v1.json`
- State is written atomically for crash-safety.
- Schema versioning is in place for future migrations.
- News is blurred on entry and only shown after explicit confirmation.

---

## Notes

- MotoGP participants are labeled as Riders throughout the app.
- Season reset clears picks and results while preserving players and settings.
- The News tab is always visible and opens behind a spoiler-confirmation gate.
